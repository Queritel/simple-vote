# TODO/Refactor

- Make into a simple link sharing methodology, with transparent voting(you know who voted for what). You create a poll, and have a shareable link.
- People go to that link, enter a name(if they haven't already), and make their votes. (An infinite-length UUID/name cookie is set on that browser for an ID, if it doesn't already exist)
- A setting exists to change your name. 
- For votes over 5/10, possibly show an expand that has their name next to it.
- People can add poll options. 
- You can see a list of users who voted and click View Ballot to see their ballot.  
- You can clear your vote.
- You can set a threshold, but the default is 30%. 
- Rewrite backend, use postgres
- Use hashid
- Rewrite front end in angular2.
